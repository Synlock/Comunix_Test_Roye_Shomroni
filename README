I have implemented all extra credit features.

There are a few possible changes I could have made, such as:
1. Saving all relevant data to a binary/json file locally on the device or online to a database.
2. Currently the leaderboards update after every game, could have saved a highscore and used above method for permenant saving.
3. Smarter rock/ball behavior
4. Possibly a few other things that I am forgetting right now :)

I am happy to answer any further questions or concerns you have.
